  <h1>😎MURIGI JESSIE WAINAINA😎</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to <em>Moi</em></h2>

  <img src="images/funny.jpg" alt="funny meme">
  <p>LIke the Indian guy has said, I was born when I was a child with a clean slate for a brain and the attention span of a high school student in a poetry class</p>

  <!--Background-->
  <h2><u>My Life History</u></h2>

  <img src="images/mchuo.jpeg" alt="Meru School">
  <h3></h3>
  <p>Recently I can now confidently say I am an alumni of my alma mater <strong>The Meru School.</strong> As we loved to joke about, it is the only public school in the country that begins with a definit article. <em>(Beat that Alliance..hahaha)</em>
    Found in the miraa chewing county of Meru where the common greeting for a newbie is <em>Baite Murumwe,</em>
    it is a school that transcends race and religion bringing together teens from every walk of life. My home for the past 5 years <em>(Damn u corona)</em>, Meru School has given me the conducive environment to explore my inner idiot. Admission
    number 10517 was my licence number, one which I struggled to hide from members of the opposite gender to conceal the fact I was a form one or <strong>mono.</strong></p>

  <img src="images/jobless.jpeg" alt="I got no job">
  <p>Like most millenials of my generation, employment at a young age is often termed as child-labour, hence my lack of any work experience. I find it weird that the system expects so much of ,e, especially the boy child yet it teaches me zilch on
    money....BOOHOO.....But guess who wants to deal crypto????? I guess taking pills in Ibiza and eating cake by the ocean will have to wait just a tad bit longer </p>

  <img src="images/hacker.jpeg" alt="Hacker imminent">
  <p>My programming story is pretty interesting. I have always had a thing for tech. Someetimes I saw myself as the guy who would end up building a robot girlfriend for himself.<em>Luckily I am good with the ladies..oink.</em> So, with the curiosity
    of how Google operates and whyy FaceBook is hell-bent on data privacy or why Bill Gates is so damn wealthy, I got to narrow it down to computers. Every click, every drag turned my instincts on. Seeing hackers on the telly made me tingle with
    excitement, fuelling my want and passion for the computer abd all functions it executes. I love kidding around but my fsmily better be careful. YOU ARE MY GUINEA PIGS...HOPE YOUR PASSWORDS ARE IN ORDER🤗</p>

  <!--interests-->
  <h2><u>Me Likey</u></h2>

  <img src="images/japanese monster.jpeg" alt="japanese monster">
  <p>If it were possible, I would marry cars coz unlike girls, <strong>they don't break your heart!!</strong> The roaring an engine, the spooling of turbos and the smoking tires (<em>Remember kids, smoke tires not drugs</em>)All the raw monster
    energy jammed in mankind's greatest invention; <span style="font-weight:bold">The Automobile,,,</span>All the way from retro Chevvys and Impalasa to modern day Bugattis and Rolls-Royces, cars have come a long way from not only being a convenient
    form of transport but also a status symbol with rappers flexing diamond grills and hgh end lamborghinis and Cadillacs. Gimme 10 years and have a look at my garage. A Showroom I tell you😆</p>

  <img src="images/cash.jpeg" alt="cash money">
  <p>Let's be honest; who doesn't love cash? Everyone says the love of money is the root of all evil. Well to hell with that! No wonder such people are poor. On the other hand, i love money. Them Benjamins and Them Jomo Kenyattas keep a smile on my
    face each and every day of my life. Imagine a life free of care....come on why go to Mombasa and fight hoards of people to get a slot on a ferry from the colonial era when you can splurge on a top-tier yacht and sail the seven seas like a boss.
    Explore the Carribean like Christopher Columbus. Fly on a private jet; breakfast in Nairobi, Lunch in Abu Dhabi and dinner in London. Food for thought.</p>

  <img src="images/party -animal.jpg" alt="hanging with friends">
  <p>My frinds have always been a big part of my life. Back in high school, we could always sneak out of class to watch movies in the compiuter lab. We tried every co-curricular activity thinkable before settling for music festival where, with no
    idea of who is reading this, things happened. Best to keep things on the low. Fast forward to the KCSE period when all we did was throw books at each other and crumple papers waiting to rain them down on a sleeping fellow(<em>A little sth to keep
      them on toes.</em>) Camping, photoshoots, playing video games, fantasizing about how successful we will be in the middle of the night instead of studying (<em>To be honest, that exam was a waste of time, sleep and brainpower</em>) Having
    friends from both sides of the divide is fun. Sure you get the occassional squabbles and crushes, but hey, always gotta have some fun with both. <span style="color:red">THIS LIFE HAS NO SEASON 2!!!</span></p>

  <h2><u>What do I like doing...Good question</u></h2>

  <img src="images/swish.jpg" alt="basketball dunk">
  <p>SAdly I am the least athletic person I can think of💔....However, when i do decide to put my best foot forward, basketball always seems to come in mind. I remember one stint in high where i was nicknamed <strong>Jordan</strong>(<em>I think they were making fun of my skills🤣</em>). Don't great me wrong, I am a big fun of the greats, Michael and King James. Come to think of it though, I may be the only Kenyan man who doesn't like football. Just between you and me, I support Manchester United and Bayern Munich incase anyone asks.</p>

  <img src="images/mtuno.jpg" alt="sleepy head">
  <p>Believe you me, if you have studied in a Kenyan high school, you would know that chemistry class, especially <span style="font-weight:bold">Mole Concept</span> and <strong>Organic Chemistry</strong> were total snooze fests and a perfect afternoon siesta. Ever had Double mathematics after lunch and the teacher stole the P.E lesson making it triple maths😭. What about the poetry lesson when the teacher exaggerated the color blue in a single sentence? I got to develop the formidable art of sleeping with my eyes open and experiencing fantasia unlike any other during class. No offense Moringa.</p>
